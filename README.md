# PKMN-AI

PKMN-AI is an artificial intelligence bot that automates the process of playing Pokemon.

The script will observe the user's main output device and automatically begin playing the game of Pokemon.

Utilizes Computer Vision and machine learning to play throughout the game and recognize specific Pokemon encounters.

Beneficial for maintaining encounter metrics and data for shiny hunters.

# Features

- Option to customize the AI for different resoulutions and display settings
- Works with a multitude of themes, fonts, and MODs to the game
- Stores encounter data for following sessions/restarts
- Displays current encounters live on screen in a separate Pygame window

# Compatability & Expectations

> The AI must be able to recognize the HP (hit points) Bar on the screen to enter a counting state and track the encounter (no widgets or windows can block the HP Bar).
